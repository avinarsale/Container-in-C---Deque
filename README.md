# Containers in C++

# Map

Implemented a container class template named Map similar to the std::map class from the C++ Standard Library with any type support for key or value. My implementation is using skip list data structure which meets O(lg(N)) for key lookup, insertion, and deletion; and O(1) for all iterator increments and decrements.

# Deque

Implemented a double-ended queue container using macro as type-safe template by following test-driven development process with respect to test.cpp. Queue behavior is circular with dynamic array. Further, it has iterator functionality for bookkeeping information.
